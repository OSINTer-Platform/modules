This includes initiating the DB (and thereby creating the relevant users and tables), writing and reading the article OG Tags to and from the DB and marking articles as saved for user. Used both by [OSINTwebserver](https://github.com/bertmad3400/OSINTwebserver) and [OSINTbackend](https://github.com/bertmad3400/OSINTbackend). |
| ![OSINTextract](https://github.com/bertmad3400/OSINTmodules/blob/master/OSINTextract.py) | Responsible for extracting the interresting contents from articles after they have been scraped, either in form of the OG tags, or the article content. This is mostly where the data from [OSINTprofiles](https://github.com/bertmad3400/OSINTprofiles) is used actually used (though it's collected in ![OSINTprofiles.py](https://github.com/bertmad3400/OSINTmodules/blob/master/OSINTprofiles.py)) and is solely used by the [OSINTbackend](https://github.com/bertmad3400/OSINTbackend). |
| ![OSINTfiles](https://github.com/bertmad3400/OSINTmodules/blob/master/OSINTfiles.py) | Responsible handling writing articles to locale files on disk.

Used both by ![OSINTwebserver](https://github.com/bertmad3400/OSINTwebserver) and ![OSINTbackend](https://github.com/bertmad3400/OSINTbackend). |
| ![OSINTprofiles](https://github.com/bertmad3400/OSINTmodules/blob/master/OSINTprofiles.py) | Responsible for collecting the relevant information from the profiles. Used both by [OSINTwebserver](https://github.com/bertmad3400/OSINTwebserver) and [OSINTbackend](https://github.com/bertmad3400/OSINTbackend). |
| ![OSINTscraping](https://github.com/bertmad3400/OSINTmodules/blob/master/OSINTscraping.py) | Responsible for doing the scraping of websites, and extracting the list of URL's for articles from either the frontpage or RSS feed. Used soleley by [OSINTbackend](https://github.com/bertmad3400/OSINTbackend). |

| ![OSINTtext](https://github.com/bertmad3400/OSINTmodules/blob/master/OSINTtext.py) | Responsible for cleaning the article content text for tag generation and generate the tags. Used soleley by [OSINTbackend](https://github.com/bertmad3400/OSINTbackend). |
| ![OSINTuser](https://github.com/bertmad3400/OSINTmodules/blob/testing/OSINTuser.py) | Responsible for handling the users, whether that creating new users, logging existing users in or gathering a users preferences from the DB.

| ![\_\_init\_\_.py](https://github.com/bertmad3400/OSINTmodules/blob/testing/__init__.py) | Responsible for enabling [OSINTwebserver](https://github.com/bertmad3400/OSINTwebserver) and [OSINTbackend](https://github.com/bertmad3400/OSINTbackend) to import scripts from [OSINTmodules](https://github.com/bertmad3400/OSINTmodules) using the wildcard operator (\*)|
